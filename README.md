To run mcp-server, use the command:
```bash
    mcp dev main.py
```
   - This will start the server and you can interact with it using the MCP protocol.
   - To stop the server, you can use `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where the server is running.
   Note: If you are getting a timeout error while fetching jobs, you can increase the request timeout value in the configuration section on the server ui.
